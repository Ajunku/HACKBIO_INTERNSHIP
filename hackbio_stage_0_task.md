## BREAST CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY


## Introduction

Breast cancer is a disease that occurs in the breast cells/tissues. It is a disease in which unusual breast cells grow out of control, thereby resulting in tumors (WHO, 2024).


## Risk Factors

Among many other factors, the female gender predisposes an individual to the risk of developing breast cancer. Thus, breast cancer occurs more in women than men. According to the World Health Organization’s fact sheet of March, 2024, women account for about 99% of breast cancer incidence, while the percentage of occurrence in men is about 0.5–1%. The use of birth control pills, late commencement of childbearing, family history, smoking, alcohol consumption and exposure to radiation are other risk factors associated with breast cancer. These notwithstanding, individuals without any association with these factors have also developed breast cancer. Many women with no family history of breast cancer have been found to develop breast cancer.


## Prevalence

As of 2020, breast cancer has become the most diagnosed cancer globally, surpassing lung and prostate cancers (Arzanova and Mayrovit, 2022). Breast cancer is responsible for many deaths globally, with about 670 000 deaths globally in 2022 alone (WHO, 2024).

Breast cancer is mostly prevalent in advanced regions of the world such as Europe and North America. This has been attributed to many factors, including but not limited to late commencement of childbearing, use of birth control pills and the use of cosmetic products such as creams and deodorants, which are less obtainable in the underdeveloped and the developing world. Incidence of breast cancer has also been on increase in the Global South which includes Asia, Africa and South America.


## Symptoms

Symptoms of breast cancer include breast lumps, changes in nipple appearance, and abnormal liquid discharge from the breast.


## Treatment

Treatment of breast cancer can be done in many ways. Doctors combine treatments to minimize the chances of the cancer coming back (WHO, 2024). Such treatment procedures include radiation therapy, surgery and medications.


## Conclusion

According to Bray _et al,_ 2004, early detection of breast cancer is inversely proportional to its mortality and therefore, screening and increased awareness of breast cancer by an individual lead to better outcomes. There is a need for conscious efforts towards increasing public awareness about breast cancer. Such awareness could target populations at risk, with content focussing on the risk fact.
